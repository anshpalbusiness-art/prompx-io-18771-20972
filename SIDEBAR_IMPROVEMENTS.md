# Sidebar Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to AppSidebar.tsx

### 1. **Scroll Position Persistence**
- Added `sidebarContentRef` to track the sidebar scroll container
- Implemented `saveScrollPosition()` that stores scroll position to `sessionStorage`
- Implemented `restoreScrollPosition()` that retrieves and applies saved scroll position
- Added debounced scroll event listener (100ms) to save position during scrolling
- Position persists across navigation and page re-renders within the same session

### 2. **Auto-Expand Sections with Active Items**
- Added `openSections` state to manage collapsible section states
- Created `getDefaultOpenStates` memoized function that detects which sections contain active items
- All collapsible sections now use controlled `open` and `onOpenChange` props
- Sections automatically expand when their items become active
- Account & Tools sections default to open, others open when containing active items

### 3. **Active Item Scroll Into View**
- Added `activeItemRef` that attaches to the currently active menu button
- Implemented `scrollActiveItemIntoView()` with smooth scrolling behavior
- 150ms delay ensures collapsible sections expand before scrolling
- Automatically triggers when route changes
- Uses `scrollIntoView` with `block: 'nearest'` to avoid unnecessary jumps

### 4. **State Management & Performance**
- All menu buttons now conditionally receive the `activeItemRef` when active
- Used `useMemo` for computing default open states to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Debounced scroll position saving to reduce sessionStorage writes
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timeouts in useEffect

## Technical Details

### Key Functions
- `saveScrollPosition()`: Saves current scroll position to sessionStorage
- `restoreScrollPosition()`: Retrieves and applies saved scroll position
- `scrollActiveItemIntoView()`: Smoothly scrolls active item into viewport
- `getDefaultOpenStates`: Determines which sections should be open based on active route

### State & Refs
- `sidebarContentRef`: Reference to scrollable sidebar content container
- `activeItemRef`: Reference to currently active menu button
- `scrollTimeoutRef`: Debounce timer for scroll position saving
- `openSections`: Controlled state for collapsible section open/close status

### Storage
- Uses `sessionStorage` for scroll position (key: `sidebar-scroll-position`)
